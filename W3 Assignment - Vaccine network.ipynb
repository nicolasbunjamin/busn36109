    "A vaccine is being produced at different manufacturing Plants to be distributed across the United States to various Hospitals. Each Plant first ships its vaccines to one or more Warehouses.  The Warehouses then ship the vaccines to the Hospitals.\n",

    "Our task is to determine the quantities each Plant should ship to each Warehouse, and then the quantities each Warehouse should ship to each Hospital each week.  \n",

    "Assumption:  You can assume, as this data indicates, that the total Plant capacity is no greater than the Hospital demand.\n",

    "We estimate our cost of transportation by considering the *Rectilinear* distance between each Plant and Warehouse, and between each Warehouse and Hospital.  Rectilinear travel restricts movement along the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes. It is commonly used to approximate travel along a road grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transportation cost is $1 per vaccine case traveling one unit of our map distance. The rectilinear distance between two points `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` is `abs(x_2 - x_1) + abs(y_2 - y_1)`.   The Python `abs` function returns the absolute value of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the distance between `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` is `abs(1 - 0) + abs(1 - 0) = 2`, and transporting `100` vaccine cases would therefore cost `100 cases * 2 distance units * $1/(case-distance) = $200`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each manufacturing plant and warehouse seeks to send as many cases as possible in order to meet hospital demand. Because vaccines are extremely valuable, hospitals should not receive any additional cases exceeding their immediate requirements.  Each manufacturing plant can ship vaccines to multiple warehouses, and each warehouse can send vaccine to multiple hospitals. And each hospital can receive vaccines from multiple warehouses. The number of vaccine cases sent and received should be modeled as a Continuous variable ... that is, one can ship a fraction of a case (This is to keep our model quick to solve, not to capture any realities of a transportation network).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model will answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the optimal allocation of vaccine cases that best meets hospital needs while minimizing total transportation and warehousing costs? In other words, how many cases of vaccines should each manufacturing plant send to each warehouse, and each warehouse to each hospital?** \n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:  Make all your flow variables Continuous.  That is, it is fine to ship a fraction of a case of vaccine.**\n",
