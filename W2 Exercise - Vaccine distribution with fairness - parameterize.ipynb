    "We estimate our cost of transportation by considering the *Rectilinear* distance between each Plant and Hospital.  Rectilinear travel restricts movement along the horizontal (x) and vertical (y) axes. It is commonly used to approximate travel along a road grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "The transportation cost is $1 per vaccine case traveling one unit of our map distance. The rectilinear distance between two points `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` is `abs(x_2 - x_1) + abs(y_2 - y_1)`.   The Python `abs` function returns the absolute value of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the distance between `(0, 0)` and `(1, 1)` is `abs(1 - 0) + abs(1 - 0) = 2`, and transporting `100` vaccine cases would therefore cost `100 cases * 2 distance units * $1/(case-distance) = $200`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each manufacturing plant seeks to send as many cases as possible in order to meet hospital demand. Because vaccines are extremely valuable, hospitals should not receive any additional cases exceeding their immediate requirements.  Each manufacturing plant can ship vaccines to multiple hospitals, and each hospital can receive vaccines from multiple manufacturing plants. You can assume that the number of vaccine cases sent and received is always an integer number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your model should answer the following question:\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the optimal allocation of vaccine cases to hospitals that minimizing total transportation cost, without exceeding the requirements of any hospital?   In other words, how many cases of vaccines should each manufacturing plant send to each hospital?** \n",
